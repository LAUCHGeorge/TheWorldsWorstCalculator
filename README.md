This is the worlds worst Calculator.

A very simple Calculator I created to improve upon my Java skills.

What this project currently includes:
-  A very very very simple Calculator

What this project is going to include in the future:
-  A better User Interface
-  The ability to type your calculation as one big string
-  Various new calculation features

If you are reading this and plan to look through this repo, 
feel free to give me some tips on how to improve my coding skills!

I do also want to mention that v1.0.0 of this calculator is even as of me writing this readme,
already incredibly old. So I am aware that it absolutely sucks.

Thanks for reading! ~lauch | TheWorldsWorstCalculator
